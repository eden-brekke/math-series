## Tests
How do you run tests? 
    
* Using pytest and the requirements.txt that is up on the github repo

Any tests of note?   

* Just some standard tests for fibonacci, lucas, and sum_series functions.   
* I wasn't sure how many to include so I added a handful for each function.

Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc  
* Think all my tests are complete :)
